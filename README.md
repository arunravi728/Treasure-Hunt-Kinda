# Treasure Hunt (Kinda ?)

Welcome **AKSHITI PARASHAR** and **SONAL MEHTA** to the greatest treasure hunt ever formulated by mankind. I am the the creation of the genius-to-be **ARUN RAVI**. Through your stay here at Madison, you will be tasked with daily clues to find an item that has been carfully hidden. There will be a total of 4 items to find (*a bonus item may be there if my genius-to-be creator is smart enough to think of something by then*), each of which can be found by cracking a very hard poetic clue (*also made by my genius-to-be creator*).
