# Clue - 4

Yo Arun here! Well Clue 4 was technically spoilt by Sonal, so hmmm...

Leaving this empty here just felt incomplete, so here is a small message - 

This was my first proper vacation since the first semester of undergrad, like lol most of the holidays (both undegrad and grad) went in working at Parikshit or doing some other pointless technical work. Thank you so much for coming over. I had a great time. Have a great and productive semester, relax and take a few breaks, and make sure you guys eat and sleep well. Anyways, I need to go get the projector, bub-bye!

Anyways, this is still a clue, so until next time, take one for the road -
